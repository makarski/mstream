# MongoDB keyfile for replica set authentication
# 
# This file should NOT be committed to version control.
# 
# For local development, generate a keyfile dynamically or create it manually.
# For production, use a secure, unique keyfile and manage it with a secrets manager.
# 
# Example (to generate a keyfile):
#   openssl rand -base64 756 > local/scripts/mongo-keyfile
# 
# Add this file to .gitignore to prevent accidental commits.
